<p>Once you’ve made your way to the website, or you have a local instance of DEBrowser running, you will be greeted with data loading section:</p>
<img alt="../_images/data_load.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/data_load.png" />
<p>To begin the analysis, you need to upload your <em>count data file</em> (comma or semicolon separated (CSV), or tab separated (TSV) format) to be analyzed under the “Upload your Count Data File” section and choose appropiate separator for the file (comma, semicolon or tab).</p>
<p>If you do not have a dataset to upload, you can use the built in demo data file by clicking on the ‘Load Demo!’ button.  To view the entire demo data file, you can download
this <a class="reference external" href="https://bioinfo.umassmed.edu/pub/debrowser/simple_demo.tsv">demo set</a>.  For an example case study, try our <a class="reference external" href="https://bioinfo.umassmed.edu/pub/debrowser/advanced_demo.tsv">advanced demo</a>.</p>

<p>Metadata file can be formatted with comma, semicolon or tab separators similar to count data files. These files used to establish different batch effects for multiple conditions.
You can have as many conditions as you may require, as long as all of the samples are present.</p>
<p>To load the metadata, you need to upload your file under <strong>Upload your ‘Metadata File’</strong> section and select the column separator.</p>
<p>Once the count data and metadata files has been loaded in Debrowser, you can click upload button to visualize the your data as shown at below:</p>
<img alt="../_images/upload_summary.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/upload_summary.png" />
<p>After loading the gene quantification file, and if specified the metadata file containing your batch correction fields, you then have the option to filter low counts and conduct batch effect correction prior to your analysis. Alternatively you may skip these steps and directly continue with differential expression analysis or view quality control (QC) information of your dataset.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="low-count-filtering">
<h2>Low Count Filtering<a class="headerlink" href="#low-count-filtering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this section, you can simultaneously visualise the changes of your dataset while filtering out the low count genes. Choose your filtration criteria from <strong>Filtering Methods</strong> box which is located just center of the screen. Three methods are available to be used:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Max:</strong> Filters out genes where maximum count for each gene across all samples are less than defined threshold.</li>
<li><strong>Mean:</strong> Filters out genes where mean count for each gene are less than defined threshold.</li>
<li><strong>CPM:</strong>      First, counts per million (CPM) is calculated as the raw counts divided by the library sizes and multiplied by one million. Then it filters out genes where at least defined number of samples is less than defined CPM threshold.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>After selection of filtering methods and entering threshold value, you can proceed by clicking <strong>Filter</strong> button which is located just bottom part of the <strong>Filtering Methods</strong> box. On the right part of the screen, your filtered dataset will be visualized for comparison as shown at figure below.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/filtering.png"><img alt="../_images/filtering.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/filtering.png" style="width: 99%;" /></a>
<p>You can easily compare following features, before and after filtering:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Number of genes/regions.</li>
<li>Read counts for each sample.</li>
<li>Overall histogram of the dataset.</li>
<li>gene/region vs samples data</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p class="last">To investigate the gene/region vs samples data in detail as shown at below, you may click the <strong>Show Data</strong> button, located bottom part of the data tables. Alternatively, you may download all filtered data by clicking <strong>Download</strong> button which located next to <strong>Show Data</strong> button.</p>

<p>Afterwards, you may continue your analysis with <strong>Batch Effect Correction</strong> or directly jump to differential expression analysis or view quality control (QC) information of your dataset.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="batch-effect-correction">
<h2>Batch Effect Correction<a class="headerlink" href="#batch-effect-correction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If specified metadata file containing your batch correction fields, then you have the option to conduct batch effect correction prior to your analysis. By adjusting parameters of <strong>Options</strong> box, you can investigate your character of your dataset. These parameters of the options box are explained as following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Normalization Method:</strong> DEBrowser allows performing normalization prior the batch effect correction. You may choose your normalization method (among DESeq2, TMM, RLE, upperquartile), or if you don’t want to normalize your data you can select <strong>none</strong> for this item.</li>
<li><strong>Correction Method:</strong> DEBrowser uses <a class="reference external" href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/sva/inst/doc/sva.pdf">ComBat</a> (part of the SVA bioconductor package) or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.7/bioc/vignettes/Harman/inst/doc/IntroductionToHarman.html">Harman</a> to adjust for possible batch effect or conditional biases. For more information, you can visit following links for documentation: <a class="reference external" href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/sva/inst/doc/sva.pdf">ComBat</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.7/bioc/vignettes/Harman/inst/doc/IntroductionToHarman.html">Harman</a></li>
<li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Please select the column that is specified in metadata file for comparision, such as cancer vs control. It is named <em>condition</em> for our sample metadata.</li>
<li><strong>Batch:</strong> Please select the column name in metadata file which differentiate the batches. For example in our metadata, it is called <em>batch</em>.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Upon clicking submit button, comparison tables and plots will be created on the right part of the screen as shown below.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/batch_PCA.png"><img alt="../_images/batch_PCA.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/batch_PCA.png" style="width: 99%;" /></a>

<p>You can investigate the changes on the data by comparing following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Read counts for each sample.</li>
<li>PCA, IQR and Density plot of the dataset.</li>
<li>Gene/region vs samples data</li>

<p class="last">You can investigate the gene/region vs samples data in detail by clicking the <strong>Show Data</strong> button, or download all corrected data by clicking <strong>Download</strong> button.</p>
</div>
<p>Upon meta-data loading, you will then be able to select from a drop down box that will specify which
column you want to use for analysis.</p>
<p>For more information about the input file or the potential Differential Expression Analysis programs, please visit our DE analysis tab within DEBrowser documentation.  Once you’ve selected your file and the upload has completed, you will then be shown the samples listed within your file uploaded as well as a few options.</p>
<img alt="../_images/file_load.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/file_load.png" />
<p>The first option, ‘Go to DE Analysis’, takes you to the next step within the DESeq workflow.
In order to run DESeq on your input data you first need to select which samples will go into your
conditions.  You can run multiple condition comparisons and view the results seperately as well.
To remove samples from a condition, simply select the sample you wish to remove and hit the delete/backspace key.
To add a sample to a condition you simply have to click on one of the condition text boxes to bring up a list of
samples you can add to that comparison.  Click on the sample you wish to add from the list and it will be added
to the textbox for that comparison.</p>
<img alt="../_images/de_analysis.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/de_analysis.png" />
<p>The second option, ‘Go to QC plots!’, takes you to a page where you can view quality control metrics on your data input.
The page opens with a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plot.  You are able to adjust the size of the plots on the menu
to the left under ‘width’ and ‘height’ as well as alter a variety of other variables to adjust the specific plot you’re viewing.
You can change the type of dataset being viewed within these QC plots by selecting the dataset you want at the top of the left panel.
If you submitted a batch meta data file along with your input file, you can also filter the PCA plot based on the specific batch groupings
that you submitted.</p>
<p>In addition to the PCA plot,  you can also select a variety of other plots to view your initial data.
The All2All plot displays the correlation between each sample, Heatmap shows a heatmap representation of your data,
IQR displays a barplot displaying the IQR between samples, and Density will display an overlapping density graph for each sample.
You also have the ability to select the type of clustering and distance method for the heatmap produced to further customize your quality control measures.
Users also have the option to select which type of normalization methods they would like to use for these specific plotting analysis within the
left menu.</p>

<img alt="../_images/density_plot.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/density_plot.png" />
<p>You can also view specific tables of your input data for each type of dataset available and search for a specific geneset
by inputting a comma-seperated list of genes or regex terms to search for in the search box within the left panel.
To view these tables, you must select the tab labeled ‘Tables’ as well as the dataset from the dropdown menu on the left panel.</p>
<p>If you ever want to change your file/condition parameters, or even ad a new set of comparisons, you can always
return to the ‘Data Prep’ to change and resubmit your data.  To completely start over, you can also hit the ‘Reset’
button on the ‘Data Prep’ page.</p>
<p>Once you are happy with your dataset and you have selected your conditions within the ‘DE Analysis’ section,
you can then hit ‘Submit!’ to begin.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="metadata-upload">
<h2>Metadata Upload<a class="headerlink" href="#metadata-upload" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you prefer to select conditions beforehand, and save them as a TSV file to upload, you have this option
as of February 2017. You can split up conditions into two groups in a TSV file, and have as many selections as
you want for different groupings.</p>
<p>To load in the specific file that contains the meta data, at the start of the DEBrowser there will be a
“Choose Meta Data File (Optional)” which you can then select the meta data file to use for this analysis.
In the metadata file, you will need to have a sample column as the first column and from then on exactly 2
groups in each column([cond1, cond2], [1, 2], etc) to be matched to the sample column. Sample TSV:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="40%" />
<col width="29%" />
<col width="31%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">sample</th>
<th class="head">select1</th>
<th class="head">selection2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>exper_rep1</td>
<td>cond1</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>exper_rep2</td>
<td>cond1</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>exper_rep3</td>
<td>cond2</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>control_rep1</td>
<td>cond2</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>control_rep2</td>
<td>cond2</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>control_rep3</td>
<td>cond2</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The example above would result in ‘select1’ having the first set of conditions as {exper_rep1, exper_rep2}
from ‘cond1’ and second set of conditions as {exper_rep3, control_rep1, control_rep2, control_rep3} from
‘cond2’ as they correspond to those conditions in the ‘sample’ column.</p>
<p>In the same way, ‘selection2’ would have the first set as {exper_rep1, exper_rep3, control_rep2} from ‘1’
and second set as {exper_rep2, control_rep1, control_rep3} from ‘2’  as they correspond to those conditions
in the ‘sample’ column.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-main-plots">
<h2>The Main Plots<a class="headerlink" href="#the-main-plots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After clicking on the ‘Submit!’ button, DESeq2 will analyze your comparisons
and store the results into seperate data tables.  Shiny will then allow you
to access this data, with multiple interactive features, at the click of a
button.  It is important to note that the resulting data produced from DESeq
is normalized. Upon finishing the DESeq analysis, a tab based menu will appear
with multiple options.</p>
<img alt="../_images/info_tabs.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/info_tabs.png" />
<p>The first tab, the ‘Main Plots’ section, is where you will be able to view
the interactive results plots.  Plot choices include:</p>
<p>Scatter plot</p>
<img alt="../_images/scatter_plot.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/scatter_plot.png" />
<p>Volcano plot</p>
<img alt="../_images/volcano.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/volcano.png" />
<p>MA plot</p>
<img alt="../_images/ma.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/ma.png" />
<p>You can hover over the scatterplot points to display more information about the point selected.
A few bargraphs will be generated for the user to view as soon as a scatterplot point is hovered over.</p>
<img alt="../_images/bargraph.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/bargraph.png" />
<img alt="../_images/barplot.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/barplot.png" />
<p>You can also select a specific region within the scatter plot and zoom in on the selected window.</p>
<img alt="../_images/scatter_plot_selection.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/scatter_plot_selection.png" />
<p>Once you’ve selected a specific region, a new scatterplot of the selected area will appear on the right</p>
<img alt="../_images/scatter_plot_zoom.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/scatter_plot_zoom.png" />
<p>You also have a wide array of options when it comes to fold change cut-off levels, padj cut-off values,
which comparison set to use, and dataset of genes to analyze.</p>
<img alt="../_images/filters.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/filters.png" />
<p>It is important to note that when conducting multiple comparisons, the
comparisons are labeled based on the order that they are input.
If you don’t remember which samples are in your current comparison
you can always view the samples in each condition at the top of the main plots.</p>
<img alt="../_images/selected_conditions.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/selected_conditions.png" />
<p>If you can select the type of plot at the bottom of the filter tab.</p>
<img alt="../_images/main_plots.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/main_plots.png" />
<p>You can download the results in CSV or TSV format by selecting your ‘File type’ and clicking the ‘download’ button once you’ve ran DESeq.
You can also download the plot or graphs themselves by clicking on the gear in the upper-left corner of each plot or graph.</p>

<h2>Quality Control Plots<a class="headerlink" href="#quality-control-plots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Selecting the ‘QC Plots’ tab will take you to the quality control plots
section.  These QC plots are very similar to the QC plots shown before
running DESeq and the dataset being used here depends on the one
you select in the left panel.  In addition to the all-to-all plot shown
within the previous QC analysis, users can also view a heatmap,PCA, IQR, and density
plots of their analyzed data by selecting the proper plot on the left
menu.  You can also choose the appropriate clustering and distance method you would
like to use for this heatmap just abot the plot just like in the previous QC section.</p>
<p>For additional information about the clustering methods used, you can consult <a class="reference external" href="https://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/stats/hclust">this website</a>.</p>
<p>For additional information about the distance methods used, you can consult <a class="reference external" href="https://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/stats/dist">here</a>.</p>
<p>For distances other than ‘cor’, the distance function defined will be ( 1 - (the correlation between samples)).
Each qc plot also has options to adjust the plot height and width, as well as a download button for a pdf output located above each plot.
For the Heatmap, you can also view an interactive session of the heatmap by selecting the ‘Interactive’ checkbox before submitting your
heatmap request.  Make sure that before selecting the interactive heatmap option that your dataset being used is ‘Up+down’.
Just like in the Main Plots, you can click and drag to create a selection.  To select a specific portion of the heatmap, make sure
to highlight the middle of the heatmap gene box in order to fully select a specific gene.  This selection can be used later within the
GO Term plots for specific queries on your selection.</p>

<h2>Heat Maps<a class="headerlink" href="#heat-maps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The heatmap is a great way to analyze replicate results of genes all in
one simple plot (Figure 17).  Users have the option to change the clustering method used
as well as the distance method used to display their heatmap.  In addition,
you can also change the size of the heatmap produced and adjust the p-adjust
and fold change cut off for this plot as well.  Once all of the parameters
have been set, click the ‘Submit!’ button at the bottom of the left menu to
generate your heatmap.</p>
<p>## Used clustering and linkage methods in heatmap</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>complete:</strong></dt>
<dd>Complete-linkage clustering is one of the linkage method used in hierarchical clustering.
In each step of clustering, closest cluster pairs are always merged up to a specified distance     threshold. Distance between clusters for complete link clustering is the maximum of
the distances between the members of the clusters.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>ward D2:</strong></dt>
<dd>Ward method aims to find compact and spherical clusters. The distance between two clusters
is calculated by the sum of squared deviations from points to centroids. “ward.D2” method uses
criterion (Murtagh and Legendre 2014) to minimize ward clustering method. The only difference
ward.D2 and ward is the dissimilarities from ward method squared before cluster updating. This
method tends to be sensitive to the outliers.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>single:</strong></dt>
<dd>Distance between clusters for single linkage is the minimum of  the distances between
the members of the clusters.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>average:</strong></dt>
<dd>Distance between clusters for average linkage is the average of the distances between
the members of the clusters.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>mcquitty:</strong></dt>
<dd>mcquitty linkage is when two clusters are joined, the distance of the new cluster
to any other cluster is calculated by the average of the distances of the soon to be
joined clusters to that other cluster.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>median:</strong></dt>
<dd>This is a different averaging method that uses the median instead of the mean.
It is used to reduce the effect of outliers.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>centroid:</strong></dt>
<dd>The distance between cluster pairs is defined as the Euclidean distance
between their centroids or means.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>## Used distance methods in heatmap</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>cor:</strong></dt>
<dd>1 - cor(x) are used to define the dissimilarity between samples. It is less
sensitive to the outliers and scaling.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>euclidean:</strong></dt>
<dd>It is the most common use of distance. It is sensitive to the outliers and scaling.
It is defined as the square root of the sum of the square differences between gene counts.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>maximum:</strong></dt>
<dd>The maximum distance between two samples is the sum of the maximum expression value of the
corresponding genes.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>manhattan:</strong></dt>
<dd>The Manhattan distance between two samples is the sum of the differences of their
corresponding genes.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>canberra:</strong></dt>
<dd>Canberra distance is similar to the Manhattan distance and it is a special form of
the Minkowski distance. The difference is that the absolute difference between the
gene counts of the two genes is divided by the sum of the absolute counts
prior to summing.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>minkowsky:</strong></dt>
<dd>It is generalized form of euclidean distance.</dd>

<p>You can also select to view an interactive version of the heatmap by clicking
on the ‘Interactive’ checkbox on the left panel under the height and width
options.  Selecting this feature changes the heatmap into an interactive
version with two colors, allowing you to select specific genes to be compared
within the GO term plots.  In order to use the interactive heatmap selection
within your GO term query, you must use either the up+down dataset or the
most varied dataset for the heatmap display.</p>
